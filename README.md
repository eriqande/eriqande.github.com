# A github:pages blog using jekyll

I put together a [course website](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/) on GitHub using Rmarkdown and building stuff locally.
That was a fun experience, but kind of a hassle in some ways.  For a lightweight GitHub Pages experience I grabbed some
templates from https://github.com/christopherpoole/ghpblog

Thanks to Christopher for making it easy to get this up and running in little time.

Right now I mostly want to have a light blog (which may end up being more of a list) about what I have been up to work-wise. I used
to keep track of that with dokuwiki, but IT here at NMFS is making it hard to run an apache server on my laptop.  So, I am going to
move all of this to GitHub.
