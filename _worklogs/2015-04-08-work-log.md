* Thursday
    * In the morning I helped Colin Nichol (from the hydrography group) with some data munging
    and R issues for about 40 minutes.  He was trying to prepare a poster for the CalNeva meeting.
    * Spent all afternoon with Thomas.  Good time.  We looked over the Bayesian model he had proposed
    for genotype calling on the Fluidigm.  But then we went back to the raw illuminance data and 
    did some comparisons between that and the relative values that come normally out of the
    fluidigm software.  After a lot of looking at data, we decided that a sort of heuristic method
    might be best for doing individual identification of sturgeon.  He is off implementing that
    now.  I think that we might want to re-extract 96 sturgeon and type them on one last plate.  
    
* Friday
    * Wrapping up all the flock-comment stuff for Dryad.
