Songbirds and Salmonids: a tale of two taxa" at the 2015 Genome 10K Conference
at the Chaminade Resort.  I spoke about our experiences using genomes in birds and
in *O. mykiss*.  I was able to highlight some of the lab's work on mykiss and
Chromosome 5.

* Wednesday.  Another long day of work at home.  I submitted the TPB paper!  And then immediately
started up on the PBT feasibility work.  Made good progress.
