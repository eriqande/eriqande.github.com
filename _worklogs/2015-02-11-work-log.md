## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)





### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* (Mon) Patrick is done with all the simulations.  I am reproducing them and cleaning them up.  We
should be ready to start writing the final version and replying to the editors soon.




### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* I'm not doing much these days on this.  Mostly other folks compiling run sizes for Eric P. Will
need to submit it to internal review once it is done.

### Pata-chinook
[_https://github.com/eriqande/pata-chinook_](https://github.com/eriqande/pata-chinook)



### pbt-feasibility

* (Thu - Mon)  Big time working on the analysis of PBT variance.  Wrote up a document about it at:
[here](https://github.com/eriqande/pbt-feasibility/blob/master/tex/sketches/pbt-tag-rate-variance.tex).  It
turns out that with really small release groups, it is more of an issue than with large release groups
(not surprisingly).
* (Mon) Met with Will to talk over some of the questions he had before his presentation.




### sib-prog-assess
[_https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess_](https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess)

### rep-res-course

### Thomas Ng


## Service, Assistance, and Interaction
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC




### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS



### Outside of NMFS

* (Mon) Reviewed a section of a manuscript for Rob Ogden.  It is going to a forensics journal.

## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_
