I haven't been reporting too much because I have been working like mad
on finishing up the PBT feasibility stuff.

At the same time I submitted the revised version of the flock comment paper.

Now it is 3/16, Monday:

*  Presented at PCS's math and science day
*  Wrote a letter of rec for Anthony
*  Wrote two letters of rec for elena venable.

I have agreed to do 2 reviews.  One for Mol Ecol.  The other for TPB. 

Tuesday

Working on pbt feasibility stuff.  I had wanted to code more stuff up, but spent most of my time
fielding questions and things from the flurry of emails going around.

Wednesday

More of the same.
