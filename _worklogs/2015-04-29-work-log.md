* Thursday
    * Phone call with Dan H. helping him with his use and interpretation of TwoMod.
    * Skyped for about 1.5 ours with David Field, a postdoc with Nick Barton in Vienna,
    about parentage of snapdragons with about 100 SNPs.  They are using SNPPIT and he was
    wondering about how the results looked.  The looked super solid.  I look forward to keeping
    in touch with them.  It is a hybrid zone and their data set might provide a good example
    case for Thomas to apply pedfactory to a hybrid zone situation.
    * Some green sturgeon stuff with Thomas.
    * Email with Danielle Frechette.  She is looking to rekindle the subspawn project.
    * Editing a draft of Thomas' advancement proposal.
    * Reading up on the coalescent at night, prepping for Coalescent Group.
    
* Friday
    * Applying a bunch of updates that Nordello requested.
    * Coalescent Group.  This was a boatload of fun.
    * Helping Thomas edit his proposal.
    * Green sturgeon stuff with Thomas.  Helping him figure out how to implement GSI
    the way I think we should do it.
    
* Monday
    * Sat in on a Skype call with Mike Blouin and Neil to talk about SNPs and parentage with
    Carlos.
    * Thomas showed me his mind-blowingly promising GSI results for the green sturgeon.  It will be
    great to confirm that the good results hold up over an entirely new set of individuals that 
    were not previously genotyped on the last four chips.  It looks super solid, like the lowest
    self-assignment posterior prob was 0.99999.  It will be great to genotype the next set of
    individuals, and when we do it, it would be nice to put a few individuals that have already
    been genotyped on there to further assess reproducibility and to assess the chance to being
    able to identify recaptures in the bycatch.
    * Met with Thomas about his advancement proposal and we worked over a couple sections of it.
    * Took a few minutes of fun time to check out some new packages from the RStudio team.
    
* Tuesday
    * Met with Steve Munch, Aaron Mamula, David Boughton.  There is some talk about offering a
    course taught by NMFS personnel for UCSC grads on quantitative research methods in
    ecology, and I went to see what they were thinking about.
    * Brainstorming on pedfactory issues with Thomas:  dealing with linked markers and cycle
    detection/enumeration, and identification of articulation points / cutsets in pedigrees.
    
* Wednesday
    * Going through Thomas's work and code on the green sturgeon. Verifying things and doing some
    cleaning and organization.
    * Got some requests for info about gsi_sim from Ryan Waples.
    * 4 hours family leave to hang with Zoe who was home from school with a cold.
