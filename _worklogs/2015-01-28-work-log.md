## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### pedfactory

* Still writing the TPB paper against the Jan 30 deadline for it. Still slowly getting the Introduction to my liking.
Nuala offered another week should I need it.  I may end up taking that, but of course, can't take too much since I have to
get back to a lot of other things soon.
* And still writing it.  Monday I got pretty much finished with the introduction.  This has been taking a long time, 
and I certainly hope I can speed up a bit when I get to the meat of the article.




### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* (Tue) Met with Devon and looked over what remains on the paper.
I've got to extract some values from Colony, but we are sort of going to
be waiting to hear back from Steve L. on a few things.  But it is close.



### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* (Wed)  Skyped with Patrick.  He has results from the simulated SNP data and also from
multiple runs of the microsat data.  We now have enough info for me to start drafting the
response letter and revising the MS.  He is going to put all the simulation code up on
github with a README and I am going to replicate the findings.



### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* Eric P. has been revising this.  This week there has been some chatter about getting
more population size estimates for populations all along the coast.

### Pata-chinook
[_https://github.com/eriqande/pata-chinook_](https://github.com/eriqande/pata-chinook)



### pbt-feasibility






### sib-prog-assess
[_https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess_](https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess)

* (Fri) Jumped back in and condensed and slurped up all the results for all the colony runs that
I did on Kanaloa.  I just have to work those back into the figures, (and I think I will not bother re-running
at different assumed gtyp error rates --- use old colony results for that), and then I'm ready to send that
back to Anthony, and ready to submit it.
*(Mon) Ha! I jumped into crunching out the colony running times while having a break from the pedfactory manuscript.


## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)





### Thomas Ng


## Service, Assistance, and Interaction
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC

* (Thu) I sat in on Marc Mangel's lecture series in quantitative fisheries.  What a great opportunity.  He
discussed logistic growth models and Beverton-Holt and Ricker stock-recruitment relationships.  I also had a
look at the homework problems.
* (Mon) Sat down with Roy M. for a few minutes to help him trouble shoot the writing of a vignette for his xtractomatic
package.  He pretty much figured it out on his own with me there, but it was good to see what he is up to.  Cool stuff!

### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS



### Outside of NMFS

* (Thu) Sat in on Eric Crandall's practice job talk.
* (Tu,Wed) Wrote up a title and abstract for the G10K meeting.  This:
* TITLE:  Genomics in salmon and songbird conservation: a tale of two taxa
* ABSTRACT:  The recent availability of genomic data from a wide range of vertebrate taxa has been a boon to conservation biologists.  I will highlight two examples I have been involved in: the creation of "molecular bird bands" for identifying the breeding origin of migratory passerines, and dissecting the genetic basis of migratory behavior of the federally-listed, endangered steelhead trout.  I will provide the conservation context and background in each case and describe the role that genomic technologies and genomes have played in each.  A picture emerges from these two cases that emphasizes the value of having near-complete and well-assembled genomes, which highlights the importance of the G10K consortium's work on improving and evaluating assembly methods.  At the same time it underscores some of the difficulties faced in using available genomic data for conservation purposes.
* (Wed) I wrote a letter of commitment to be a mentor, and sent a two-page CV to Anna Lowe
for her Sea Grant Fellowship Application.
* (Wed)  Helped Kristen get some Fluidigm data from swainy's in the hybrid zone formatted
for some analyses.


## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_
