* Thursday
    * Got reviews back on the TPB pedfactory paper.  Minor revisions.
    Spent some time reading over things to address that.  Found Auggie Kong's 
    work on blocking Gibss sampling to be helpful.  Should not be difficult
    to do the revisions.
* Friday
     * On holiday going to Ann Arbor, but did work for three hours on the
     plane.  I spent time re-reading some of Wang's work on estimating Nb
     so I could offer some assistance to Dave Hankin on parentage
     mark-recapture work, and then I re-read Matthew Stephens work on PHASE
     and his JRSS B paper with Donnelly to get my head around their
     approximations again. This is relevant to calling microhaplotypes.
     
* Monday
    * Flying back from Detroit.  Got three hours of work in. I refreshed my
     memory on pedvis and on my little
     SumProduct implementation so I could make a large worked exampled for the
     TPB paper, then created a few new
    figures for the TPB paper.
* Tuesday
    * Correspondence with Dave Hankin regarding parentage mark-recapture.
    * Correspondence with Patrick Barry re: FLOCK comment stuff and the fine
    work he did to address some of Pierre's questions/comments/complaints
    * Talking with Anthony about how to do the short read haplotype inference.
    * Lab meeting.
    
* Wednesday
    * Great day.  Coded up some things in `microhaps_np.` Starting to doodle with Matthew's
    predictive distribution to be used for inferring microhaplotypes using pseudo-Gibbs
    sampling.  It's actually shaping up quite nicely.  
    * Provided some help to Thomas for his presentation and watched his practice talk.
