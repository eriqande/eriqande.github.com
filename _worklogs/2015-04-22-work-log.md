* Thursday
    * Paper accepted: Eric C. Anderson and Patrick D. Barry (Accepted) Interpreting the 
    FLOCK algorithm from a statistical perspective. _Molecular Ecology Resources_.
    * Heinous time suck getting together the copyright forms for flock comment.  These seem
    to have gotten more time consuming for Wiley than ever before.
    * Working on sturgeon things with Thomas.
    * Review of that TPB paper.
    
    
* Friday
    * Replied to a reference request for David Vendrami.
    * Helping Roy M. out on a fun R question about namespaces.
    * CA rec paper---getting back to Will on a few last issues.
    * Green sturgeon.  Looking over Thomas' shoulder on figuring out how to score these loci.
    Having the re-scored individuals is incredibly helpful.
    * More review for TPB.  Finally have my head around it and am ready to write my report.
    
* Monday
    * Paper accepted:  Mari Hagenlund, Kjartan Østbye, Kjell Langdal, Marius Hassve, 
    Ruben A. Pettersen, Eric Anderson, Finn Gregersen, Kim Præbel (Accepted) 
    Fauna crime: elucidating the potential source and introduction history of European smelt
    (_Osmerus eperlanus_ L.) into Lake Storsjøen, Norway. _Conservation Genetics_.
    * Sent some letters of rec  (Elena and David V.)
    * Going over cluster scoring on sturgeon with Thomas.
    * Re-doing cal-rec-gsi analyses on a variety of "resolutions" (different degrees of aggregation)
    to compare all 5 years against CWTs.  Actually I started doing that, but then re-read the
    paper and realized that we had already made it clear that we did all the different levels of
    aggregation just for 1998, and that there wasn't a pressing need to re-do it for all the
    different years.
    * Mid-term review meeting.
    * Send TPB paper manuscript to Carlos for internal review.
    
* Tuesday
    * Writing on the TPB review.
    * Meeting with Thomas on sturgeon.
    * Lab meeting.
    
* Wednesday
   * 1 hour family leave to take zoe to the dentist
   * Email with Dave Field, a postdoc with Nick Barton re: SNPPIT.  Gonna skype with him tomorrow.
   * Long discussion with Anthony re: Stacks settings and BLAT.  Productive.
   * Finished my review for TPB.  Phew!
   * Email with Mike Blouin and Neil Thompson about SNP genotyping in mykiss.
   * Talked with Bill Templin about helping out as an external reviewer on a couple of issues
   with a big chum/pink hatchery evaluation that involves parentage.
