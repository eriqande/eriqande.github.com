Fri Jun 26, 2015
    * 2 hours family leave in the morning.
    * Working on improving gsi_sim.



Thu Jun 25, 2015

    * Checked in with Anthony in morning and we talked about the GSI project, NGS, bioinformatics, and most of all about Bayescan and Lositan and how we interpret Martha's results from those programs.
    * Helping Martha extract some genotypes from particular loci that Bayescan identifies as outliers, but which manifestly are not.
    * Computer maintenance stuff.
    * Reading up on the Junction Tree algorithm, trying to understand that.  It is relevant to pedfactory calculations.
    * Looking over Thomas' results on computing the values of different messages coming out of libDAI.
    * At night looking over gsi_sim code to figure out how to fix an underflow problem when 1,000s
    of loci are used.
