This week I have been relishing the chance to not have any lecture-writing
deadlines until Tuesday (which is at the end of my week which runs from 
Wednesday night to the following Wednesday afternoon for reporting purposes.


## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._


### central-valley steelhead

* I read through and edited David V's draft on Sunday night.  By Monday morning I had provided edits through the methods section
and also for the _inbredPermute_ results.  I returned it at that point to the coathors before getting bogged down in writing
lectures for the rep-res-course.



### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* I put in the code to run colony on the big creek data set from within R.  Got it all
put in by Friday night.
* Then on Sunday night I launched the runs and sent a message to Devon:

> Hey man,
> sorry it has taken me some time to get those colony runs going for big creek.
> 
> They are now launched.
> 
> These lines show the fish that I included in them:

> The Pairwise run will probably be done in less than two hours.  The full model will probably take days to weeks.

* Those runs actually both finished in less than 24 hours.  Now I need to start processing the output and seeing
what we can make of it.
* On Wed., I worked on investigating the colony results and incorporating them into the
analysis.  Used `dplyr` for that and made some nice progress.  I _really_ like that package! 
This was my first day using it, but it is clearly a nicer framework than my old ways
of doing things.


### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* I emailed Pierre Duchesne and got some information from him about how they deal with alleles that don't appear in reference samples.
This was necessary to hack structure into flockture so as to have a faster implementation to run tests on.




### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* I have the most recent draft.  I plan to read it and provide comments by the 24th of Nov.




### pbt-feasibility

* I created a repositrory for this work: [_https://github.com/eriqande/pbt-feasibility_](https://github.com/eriqande/pbt-feasibility)
* Started working on the data gathering scripts and figuring out the queries necessary to get what I need off of RMIS.




### sib-prog-assess
[_https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess_](https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess)

* I need to jump on re-doing all the colony stuff with the new version of colony!  That shouldn't be too hard, it will just
take some computer time.


### wiwa-popgen

[_https://github.com/eriqande/wiwa-popgen_](https://github.com/eriqande/wiwa-popgen)

* Finished what I hope is the final round of back and forth to get everything posted up onto Dryad.
* Kristen has resubmitted the revised version.

## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)

1. Reading widely on ggplot and formulating how I want to present the grammar of graphics
and how I want to teach use of ggplot.
2. Developing a nice simple example for ggplot from pole vaulting records.
3. Much of Monday afternoon spent working on the first of two ggplot lectures.  Late into the night and a bit
on Tuesday morning as well.  It is now done.  See it [here](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/ggplot_1_pole_vault_example.html#ggplot2-intro-lecture)
4. Reading up late on Tuesday night, figuring out how the `dplyr` package works and
thinking about how to present it in the class.



### Thomas Ng

* Met with Thomas this week and told him to get me an outline by Monday night.  He did!  
* Gave him comments on it on Wednesday.


## Service and Assistance
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC

1. Helping Sam Rizza with some newhybrids questions for his cutt/sh project.



### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS

1. Got the `snppit` repository in better shape because Mike Ford wanted to download it
and use it.


### Outside of NMFS

1. Assistance to NewHybs user
2. Read a manuscript on Patagonian Chinook for javi and gave him comments.  `/Users/eriq/Documents/work/assist/javier_cancio/patagonian_chinook/CaterinaSNP_text_30_10_14_eca.doc`
I think the paper would benefit from a sensitivity analysis and slightly different
presentation of the results.
3. Answered some questions over email from James Mallet about newhybrids and how it relates to some more recent work.



## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_

1. Pulling together a work-log template (the one you are reading!)
2. filled out the NOAA parking survey for steve miller.
3. Updating info in the Emergency Network thing for the test on Dec. 3.
