This documents some of the things I did over the break and also up through
the 14th  of January.  I was  sick for the first week of Jan so that I didn't
really get back on recording work logs well until fairly recently.


## Projects

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* (Fri) Established RODBC connectivity so I can connect to the SQL server with the PIT tag data.
I wrote about the process on [my work-life blog]({{ site.url }}/2014/12/19/setting-up-rodbc.html)



### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* (Thu) Good news from Patrick, `flockture` is doing what is is supposed to be doing---behaving like `flock`.
* The deadline for resubmission came and went.  Upon my request, ME has extended it to March.




### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* (Wed) Read over the new manuscript that incorporates bycatch impact assessments.  Provided edits and comments.

### Pata-chinook
[_https://github.com/eriqande/pata-chinook_](https://github.com/eriqande/pata-chinook)

* (Thu) Tracked down the bug that was giving me funky results.  Now I just have to set up a run on the big box and
summarize it.
* (Fri) Launched the simulations.  They will take maybe 5 to 6 hours and return all the results in big, compressed RDS file.
* (Fri) Late Friday I checked on the sims and found that they had crashed because there was an improperly named
population in the baseline that I got off dryad.  Wrote a line to correct that, and relaunched.
* (Mon) Processed the simulation output and found encouraging results, but I need to go back and fix
a few things, still.
* (Xmas Night) Wrote up the supplement and tweaked the figure for this.  Sent it
to Javi and cc-ed Carlos. Results seem very encouraging to me.
* Over the remainder of the break I edited the final version for Javi and he sent it off.
Boom!


### pbt-feasibility

* (Sat)  Couple hours working on combining visually sampled and electronically sampled fish all into one framework
for estimiting stock proportions.
* Untold hours getting this squared away. I managed to write up a description of thoughts
on my Bayesian approach.  I need to implelement it still, but it looks like it ought to all work well.
* Corresponding with Will about my Bayesian approach.




### sib-prog-assess
[_https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess_](https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess)
* On Jan 12 I launched a full series of colony runs because I have decided that it has been long enough now that
we really need to use the new version of colony.  Those runs are cruising along on Kanaloa.


## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)





### Thomas Ng


## Service, Assistance, and Interaction
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC

* (Sun) After finishing that review, an hour of working with ggplot and SST rasters.  Trying to figure out how to plot these things cleanly in ggplot2.  
* (Mon) Continuing with those SST rasters.  Turns out you can't easily plot those onto `ggmap`s but
you can get some nice ones straight-up in `ggplot`.
* Helping Clemento troubleshoot a mysterious stacks failure.
* (Wed) Wrote and submitted a letter of recommendation to University of Edinburgh for David Vendrami.

### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS



### Outside of NMFS

* (Sun) 4 hours doing a review.  Ugh.  Done though!
* (Wed) Helped Ryan Whitmore (HSU) with some snppit analyses on freshwater creek fish.


## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_

* Got unison syncing my new laptop up with my other machines at work.
