* Thursday
    * Turning around the proofs for the Flock Comment paper.
    * Fixing some problems with gsi_sim on Ubuntu that Ryan Waples found.
    
* Friday
    * Morning, I set up a place on GitHub to start working on the green sturgeon manuscript and
    I started writing some of the introduction (in a fairly free-form way at this point---just
    trying to get some ideas outlined for how to pitch it.)
    
* Monday
    * Literature searching on tetraploid and polyploid analysis methods while framing the
    green sturgeon introduction.
    * 2.5 hours annual leave.
    
* Tuesday
    * Kind of a crazy day.  Morning I had a medical appointment, and then at mid-morning, Zoe had
    a desk fall over onto her foot at school requiring medical attention. I got 3 hours of work in,
    talking over haplotype-aware SNP calling with Anthony and Thomas and discussing Thomas' 
    advancement proposal with him, as well as going over the sturgeon stuff with Thomas getting it
    reproducible and up on GitHub.
    * 5 hours of family leave.

* Wednesday
    * Email to Dan H. re: river herring responses to referee comments.
    * Pedfactory and linked markers stuff.  Refreshing my memory on Lander-Green algorithm and
    thinking about whether it is possible to extend factor graph approach to linked markers.
    * 1 hour Skype with Danielle Frechette about the subspawning stuff.
    * Talking through some heterozygosity related stuff with Anthony related to Martha's summer/winter steelhead data.
    * Feeling like I am actually making some progress on linked markers in the pedfactory
    approach...
