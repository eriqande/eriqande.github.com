* Thursday
    * Thomas has his Advancement Seminar.  He gave a great, clear, understandable presentation.
    His committee wanted to see more preliminary results as evidence that he could be successful
    with the project, so they asked him to do some preliminary work and then redo his
    advancement in 6 months.  They did, however, waive the second unrelated proposal / comps
    that might have been recommended.  This is not the ideal outcome, but it is a good one in
    that Thomas can continue working on what he would have been working on anyway.  Josh Stuart 
    (on the committee) was great, and will be a valuable resource.

* Friday
    * Morning I prepped and then delivered our coalescent group meeting.  Good stuff about
    times to MRCAs and total tree lengths.
    * Afternoon, I took Thomas and Diana out to lunch with Kristen.  Diana and Kristen got to talk
    about NGS and Thomas and I got to talk about next steps.
    * After lunch, Thomas and I hacked away at the libDAI library
    (which was recommended by Josh Stuart).  We finally got it to compile
    and pass all its tests and then we coded up some R to do inference on pedigrees using it.
    Note that there is a bug in Boost 1.54 that causes branch lengths to go negative (or something)
    on the graphs, that was causing problems.  We upgraded to 1.55 and the problem was solved.  
    This was a righteous few hours of getting things going.
    * At night I read boatloads about libDAI and inference algorithms, including tree-reweighted
    belief propagation, Back BP, Uniformly-weighted BP, etc.
    
    
* Monday
    * Installed Rstudio Server on Megabox so that we can use R on it, remotely, more easily.  That
    is a truly miraculous product.  No mess, now fuss.  It is up and running and killing it!
    * Talking with Anthony about a variety of things.  Curious about Diana's results for the
    amplicon sequencing.  Looking forward to meeting with Carlos and Diana and Anthony on that soon.
    * Getting through some email that was stacked up.
    * Reviewing Pat Barry's R script to simulate and plot coalescent trees (a project he undertook
    to learn the material in Coalescent Group better.) Nice job.
    * Offering a little help to a PCS student (Aidan) working with R for his class project.
    
* Tuesday
    * Lab meeting.
    * After lab meeting, Thomas and I worked on understanding libDAI output.  Thomas found a bug in my implementation of the sum product algorithm. I 
    tracked that down late Tuesday night.  Fixed it.
    
* Wednesday
    * Verifying that I had fixed that bug.  Reading about libDAI and understanding all the classes in it. Also reading up on the Junction Tree algorithm, etc.
    * Full on insomniac tonight.  Read and edited the herring bycatch paper that is going out to CJFAS soon.
