* Thursday
    * Some correspondence with Patrick about Duchesne's questions about the flock comment paper.
    * Working on fleshing out how the pedfactory approach would work with physical linkage. Really pumped
    about where this is going...making huge progress.
    
* Friday
    * Wrote a 2 to 3  minute blurb to be read at Brown University at an awards ceremony for Elena Venable, our
    Hollings Scholar whose work in the summer of 2014 turned into her Honors thesis at Brown.
    * Prepping and doing Coalescent Group.
    * Reading up more on linkage analysis.
    * Doing some fiddling with flockture to try to illustrate some things to answer some questions from Pierre.
    

* Monday
    * Met with Shannon and Corinna from MBARI.
    * Flock comment replying to Pierre (writing some code)
    * Thinking through the factor graph with linkage
    
* Tuesday
    * 3 hours leave in the morning
    * Finally figured out where they flaw in my thinking is on the factor graph approach with linked markers.  Oh well.
    It may end up forming a good approximation.
    * Lab meeting.
    * Flock comment programming---computing 0-1 loss for single rep vs 50 rep runs to reply to a question from Pierre.
    * Then for 2.5 hours at night I wrote a message back to Pierre.
    
* Wednesday
    * Much of the day finally lending a hand to Sophie Gerber with some pine parentage.  They had sent me some data a long time ago asking for help.  It took a script like the one that appears below.
    * Thomas got me a draft of his proposal that is going to need a little working over this evening and tonight, but it 
    is looking like it is coming together.

#### Read data in and toss out indivs and loci with lots of missing data ####
# read the data in
D <- read.table("data/pedigree_recovery_56SNP_SNPPIT.txt", 
                header = TRUE, 
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE, 
                sep = "\t",
                na.strings = "") %>%
  tbl_df


# first off, note that there are some SNPs that have a lot of missing data
sort(sapply(D, function(x) mean(is.na(x))))

# and we could also look at the fraction of missing data in the individuals
missfract <- sort(daply(D, "Samples", function(x) mean(sapply(x, is.na))))

# It looks like some individuals must all be missing the same loci, but with 
# so few SNPs you can't tolerate all that much missing data anyway
# I am going to toss all individuals with 10% or more missing loci.
# This tosses out about 129 individuals
keepers <- names(missfract)[missfract < 0.10]
D2 <- D %>%
  filter(Samples %in% keepers)

# now, there are still 5 markers with more than 20% missing data.  My guess is that
# those are loci that are hard to score and are not worth keeping.  I'm gonna toss em.
tmp <- sapply(D2, function(x) mean(is.na(x)))
keeploci <- names(tmp)[tmp < 0.2]


D3 <- D2[, keeploci]


# OK, now D3 has 933 individuals and 51 SNPs. 

#### A function to turn this type of data frame to a snppit data set ####

# first, somethign to convert values:
genos <- c("A", "AC", "AG", "AT", "C", "CA", "CG", "CT", "G", "GA", "GC", "GT", "T", "TA", "TC", "TG")
nums <- c("1 1", "1 2", "1 3", "1 4", "2 2", "1 2", "2 3", "2 4", "3 3", "1 3", "2 3", "3 4", "4 4", "1 4", "2 4", "3 4")
names(nums) <- genos

#' @param D the data frame of genetic data. It assumes the first column is the sample name
#' and each other column is a locus with Sophie/Marjorie's genotype names
#' @param offspring a logical vector giving which individuals are the offspring
#' all others are assumed to be in the parent generation
make_snppit_file <- function(D, offspring, file = "snppit_input.txt") {
  
  nummy <- lapply(D[, -1], function(x) nums[as.character(x)]) %>% 
    as.data.frame(., stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
    cbind(D[,1], .)
  
  # missing data = -9
  nummy[is.na(nummy)] <- "-9 -9"
  
  parents <- nummy[!offspring, ]
  kids <- nummy[offspring, ]
  
  # now make each parent be one of each sex
  p2 <- parents
  
  parents$Samples <- paste(parents$Samples, "_as_male", "    M  ", sep = "")
  p2$Samples <- paste(p2$Samples, "_as_female", "    F  ", sep = "")
  
  # now just write it all to a file
  cat(paste("NUMLOCI", ncol(D) - 1, "\n"), file = file)
  cat("MISSING_ALLELE -9\nPOPCOLUMN_SEX\n", file = file, append = TRUE)
  write.table(cbind(names(D)[-1], 0.005), quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, file = file, append = TRUE)
  
  cat("POP Parents\n", file = file, append = TRUE)
  
  write.table(rbind(parents, p2), quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, 
              col.names = FALSE, file = file, append = TRUE,
              sep = "  ")
  
  cat("OFFSPRING Offspring Parents\n", file = file, append = TRUE)
  
  write.table(kids, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, 
              col.names = FALSE, file = file, append = TRUE,
              sep = "  ")
  
}


#### So, make a file and then run snppit ####

# make the snppit file.  Trees with a name starting with "A" are offspring.
make_snppit_file(D3, str_detect(unlist(D3[,1]), "^A") )


# let's just assume a popsize of 1000 and a life history like chinook salmon.  Clearly
# wrong but not going to fiddle with the Pi parameter right now.
system("/Users/eriq/.myaliases/snppit -f snppit_input.txt --psz-for-all 1000")


#### Light analysis of output from snppit ####

fdrs <- read.table("snppit_output_FDR_Summary.txt", header = TRUE, na.strings = "---", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  tbl_df()
assigns <- read.table("snppit_output_ParentageAssignments.txt", header = TRUE, na.strings = "---", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  tbl_df()


# here are 340 trees assigned with high confidence (fewer than 2.5% are expected to be incorrect)
hi_confidence <- assigns %>%
  filter(FDR < 0.025, MaxP.Pr.Relat == "C_Se_Se")


# let's make a plot of the FDR scores
a2 <- assigns %>% arrange(FDR)
a2$FDR_rank <- 1:nrow(a2)
ggplot(a2, aes(x = FDR_rank, y = FDR, colour = MaxP.Pr.Relat)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.025, colour = "blue")

ggsave(file = "fdr_plot.pdf", width = 10, height = 7)


# let's see how many offspring were from selfing:
pama <- hi_confidence %>%
  mutate(rawPa = str_replace(Pa, "_as_male", ""), rawMa = str_replace(Ma, "_as_female", "")) %>%
  select(rawMa, rawPa)


table(pama$rawMa == pama$rawPa)
