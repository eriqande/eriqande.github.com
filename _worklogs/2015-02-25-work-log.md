## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* Read over the manuscript Devon had sent around.  Had a few small comments which I am saving until I have addressed
some of the other stuff that Devon wants me to tackle. 




### flock-comment / flockture

* Still writing that manuscript.  Getting closer now.
* Also, on Thursday I ended up cleaning up the fullsniplings and colony simulation scripts to
make them more reproducible.
