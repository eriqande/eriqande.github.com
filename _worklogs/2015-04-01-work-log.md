* Thursday --  Monday
    * Phew!  This week was dominated by getting the PBT feasibility report wrapped up.
    * I worked quite hard on getting my section finished.  I made final edits after
    discussions with Michael and Will on Monday this week.

* Tuesday
    * Yay! back into other work.  I spend most of today putting the flock comment stuff in
    order for final submission.  
    
* Wednesday
    * I flexed this day.  Went to the exploratorium.  
    * At night, wrote some code to interface with bgc output.  bgc is the "Bayesian Genomic Clines" 
    program from Gompertz and Buerkle.  It might be useful for the Rainow/Cutt stuff.  I
    was helping kristen with a swainson's project.
    * Also, working on a review for TPB.
