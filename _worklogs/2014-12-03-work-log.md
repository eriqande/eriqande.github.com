## Projects


### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* Met with Devon, Steve, and Rundio to talk about next steps on Tuesday morning.  Steve didn't think
we could run the full mark-recapture model with family as a random effect.  So, Devon and I are going to 
do some quick and dirty analyses first:
    + I've gotta get R talking to the SQL data base again (need to do that anyway for the course)
    + Look at size of family versus genotypes to see evidence of large families not occurring for parents with
    the resident geontype.
    + quick and dirty logistic mixed model for recapture accounting for family.



### flock-comment / flockture

### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* This paper has been submitted to _Evolutionary Applications_.





### pbt-feasibility

* Over the weekend, and especially on Sunday night I worked quite a bit on undertanding
the nature of the catch-sample and recovery data bases.  Also, having a look at the PSC 4.1
data definitions that the guys at RMIS sent me in docx format.  It sort of sucks that they
don't have them in some accessible format, but .docx is better than PDF.  I can make a .txt
out of it and it looks pretty parseable. I think that might be nice for a lot of people working
with the RMIS data in R.
* I  spent much of Monday working that up.  You can see it on the course web site [here](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/string-manipulation.html#string-manipulation)
* On Wednesday, I took a big part of my morning to resurrect some of the work I did for the 2013 LOA proposal in 
which I derived variances of estimators for the contribution rate using PBT and accounting for family size. Will S.
is interested in these issues, and I felt it was worthwhile to let him know what had been done on it previously so
he doesn't reinvent the wheel.

## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)

* Friday night I spent a long bit of time getting my new laptop all set up to serve the course
up and crunch it out with Jekyll, etc.
* I then also fiddled around a bit with how to plot GPX tracks using `ggmap` and `ggplot2`.  It is
pretty darn straightforward.  There is a package `plotKML` that has a `readGPX` function that is 
useful.  `plotKML` does have a lot of dependencies though which took some wrangling to get them
all working.  But you can easily make things that look pretty nice.
* Monday, wrote a lecture on [string manipulation](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/string-manipulation.html#string-manipulation).

## Service and Assistance
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC

* Wrote and submitted letters of recommendation for David Vendrami for Ph.D. programs at UC Berkeley and UCSC.



### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS



### Outside of NMFS



## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_

* Getting my dokuwiki up and running.  Even though I tend to put all my research related stuff up on GitHub
now and don't use my wiki, I need to refer to it to search for old things on it.  So, I took some time to get
my webserver running on my laptop again (on Yosemite).  There was an excellent guide [here](http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-phpmyadmin-working-osx-10-10-yosemite/).  And then I also had to futz with 
permissions.  And i had so many files I couldn't xargs them.  So this took care of it all:

    ```sh
    2014-12-02 12:44 /tmp/--% sudo find ~/Sites/dokuwiki/data/  -print > boing
    2014-12-02 12:44 /tmp/--% for i in $(cat boing); do echo $i; sudo chown -v  eriq:www $i;  done
    ```
