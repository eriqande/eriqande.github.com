This was a nice week, punctuated with preparations for Thanksgiving, which meant
that I didn't hold the reproducible research course during the week of Thanksgiving.
This gave me a chance to start really cracking along on the PBT feasibility project.


## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* On Friday I cranked out some cool stuff with devon that led to this cool plot:
![Alt text]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/family_length_is_yoy.png "Optional title")
It shows that by taking the inferred sibling groups and plotting the lengths of the
fish, it is pretty easy to identify which sibling groups are young of the year and
which are not.
* I continued with this a bit on Sunday night, wrapping up the results for Devon so he can
give them to Lindley to put run it in the recapture models.




### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* skyped with Patrick and resolved to get back to implementing the leave-one-out correction in flockture.
* But, as of 11/28, I haven't made much progress on that...



### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* Reading and editing the manuscript on Monday.  I got that done and sent my comments
back to EP and the other coathors.
* I followed up later with a few replies to EP.  




### pbt-feasibility

* Continued chugging through the RMIS data bases, familiarizing myself with them and
cleaning them up (dealing with partial dates, etc.).
* Sunday night I focused particularly on the releases data base.  I think it is going to be good to 
focus on the period from a recent decade, but they don't have all the info in it for 2013 or 2014,
and it would be good to have releases for all recoveries within a decade.  So, maybe I can focus on
all the recoveries from 2002 to 2012 and do all the releases from 1995 to 2010 or something.
* I am going to provide a separate Rmd summary document for each of the 4 different RMIS data bases
so that I can document what I am using and how I am doing it.
* Pretty much all day Tuesday working over the releases data base.
* Then, much of the day on Wedesday downloading and familiarizing myself with the recoveries data
base and the catch-sample data base.  I think the catch-sample data base is really where the
rubber is going to hit the road on this PBT feasibility project.  It is where they have all the
good information about electronic sampling and sampling for marks from a subset of the
electronically-detected fish.




### sib-prog-assess
[_https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess_](https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess)

No progress on this.

## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)

1. On Thursday, I quickly threw together a lecture/presentation on wide vs. long format
data, the `reshape2` package, and further explorations in `ggplot`.
2. Been reading up on and using `dplyr` package a lot this week.  Planning to present on it
to the class.




### Thomas Ng

* Met with Thomas for a good while on Wednesday.  He is so quick in understanding what needs to 
be done on the pedfactory stuff, and really innovative.  
* It will be good when he has finished his advancement and can crank


## Service and Assistance
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC
* Sat in on the Staff meeting on Monday morning for Carlos.




### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS



### Outside of NMFS

* I agreed to do a review for _Molecular Ecology_.


## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_

* Got R up and cooking on the megabox.
* Working with Colin Rundel to get the isoscatR package compiling successfully.  Filed an issue,
got some great help from him and made a small pull request: https://github.com/rundel/isoscatR/issues/1  
* Spent a lot of time on T-giving and Friday getting my new laptop all set up and syncing with my
other machines.  It is a pretty sweet machine.
* Did the required Time and Attendance online training.
