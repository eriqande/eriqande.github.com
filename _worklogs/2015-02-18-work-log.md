## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._


### Pedfactory

* The deadline on this was pushed to the beginning of March, and I am hoping I can hit that.
*(Wed) All day writing on this.

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* Devon has sent me a new draft, and I need to get on that and give him comments.



### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* Been spending a lot of time making Patrick's analysis reproducible (so I can reproduce it).  By Tuesday I
pretty much have it together apart from a few lines I need to fix up in the SNP simulations.
* Then I gotta start writing the response, etc.

### pbt-feasibility

* Lots of work on this topic this week.  I have been doing a lot of data munging and getting all the
tag_codes aggregated, and re-aggregating catch locations. The current edge of developement is in
[this script:](https://github.com/eriqande/pbt-feasibility/blob/master/R-main/summarize-release-data.R)

_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC




### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS



### Outside of NMFS

* Sent some of the old SWTH results to Kristen so she can do some new things in the SWTH hybrid zone.

spend on infrastructure and learning new things_
