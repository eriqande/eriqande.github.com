* Thursday
    * Wrapping up edits for the SISG course this year.
    * Also completed a package for visualizing trace and Q value concordance between `structure`
    runs.  Check out an explanation [here](http://rpubs.com/eriqande/scot-cats).  I made it for
    pedagogical purposes, but I think it will be a nice thing to have here in the lab for sussing
    out convergence of different structure runs.
    
* Wednesday
    * Revamping some slides on the computer practical for the SISG.
    * Reviewing devtools-based package development in R.

* Tuesday
    * Crunching out a quick R-based wrapper for `structure` for ggplotting of results and traces.
    * Discussing with Thomas about an accounting system for loops in pedigree factor graphs.

* Monday
    * Family leave.



* Thursday
    * Worked on getting libDAI to do what I would like it to.  Learning a lot.
    * Spoke with Diana about kelp rockfish genotyping/sequencing strategies.
    

* Friday
    * Off.  
    
* Sunday
    * Headed to Tahoe but worked for 5 hours:
        1. Working on review for TPB
        2. Catching up on email.
        3. Writing to Carlos, Diana, and Anthony with some thoughts on how to
        do amplicon discovery and testing that also sets us up to make
        Fluidigm assays.
        4. Setting up some R libraries on Megabox.  Including compiling gdal for
        doing spatial stuff.
        
* Monday
    * One hour dealing with work email.
    
    
* Tuesday
    * Two hours working on a review for TPB, and getting stuff set up to work with Hans and Mark Bravington
    on a review for Statistical Science.
    
* Thursday
    * An hour writing up a summary of our sturgeon strategy and looking over files from Crandall.
    * 2 hours working on revisions for the TPB paper.
    
Friday
    * An hour on TPB paper revisions
    
Saturday
    * An hour on closekin stuff.
    
Monday
    * family leave taking care of zoe.
    
Tuesday
    * Reading over what Hans and Mark have for the close-kin paper for Statistical Science, and
    learning how to use LyX to write sections of it with them.
    * Working with Thomas trying to understand how the BP_dual classes in libDAI, and comparing
    the results there with the exact results from sum-product-mockup.
    * Working on the TPB revisions.
    * Met with Jazz Pouls for a little while.  He came by the thank me for advising him on his
    senior honors thesis and getting him excited about computer science sorts of things.  He is 
    off to Berkeley in August to major in EECS.
    
Wednesday
    * Reading up on Chante Davis' proposal for graph theory for explaining patterns of genetic differentiation in the Siletz river.
    * Working through some genetic mark recapture stuff that Hans and Mark Bravington are working on.
    * Catching up with Carlos on work stuff.
    * Reading some documentation for ANGSD.
