title: Work Log
---

I spent some time this week updating Apache on my laptop as per IT's request.  When I had successfully done
that I realized that my dokuwiki site was no longer accessible. Rather than take the time to get PHP working
again, I decided to ditch my dokuwiki based work log all together and move to a GitHub blog-based system.

Accordingly things aren't terribly well organized for this work log.  But here are the highlights:

#### flockture
Dealing with the flock comment paper, it became tiresome to run FLOCK by hand to get results.  It is also terribly slow.  I spent
a few hours hacking structure to behave like flock.  It is almost completely implemented.  It runs about 200 times faster and
can be scripted. Here are the [diffs](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture/compare/9c717286591423c54cf6654e8c1b7ae62e59bec4...695a8f2f30088d764d5ae7def23fa2334911e5dd) on that project for the week.

#### wiwa-popgen
Finalized the GitHub repository for distribution to Dryad.  It is pretty easy sending stuff of to Dryad from GitHub.  Nice
experience.

#### rep-res-course
Added a whole bunch of material for lectures on data frames and factors.  Also did a lot of reading up on ggplot2 and figuring
out how I want to present that.  Thankfully, though we took this week off from the course, so I have had a chance to catch
up on other work. Here are the weekly [diffs](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course/compare/aa3822c90938d7560c17e2ba5eb2b294dda7e430...d0447429e3be87e064848b0fa94a3abd624fa9d3)

#### herring
Finalized some work with Dan on the herring GSI paper.  Helped him get some figures in order, etc: [See this](https://github.com/eriqande/herring/commit/fbe41be92feae5487f235859bdb511a4c64dbc5f)

#### big-creek
I am in the process of breaking my colony scripts out of slg_pipe and turning them into a submodule, so we can easily re-use them
for big creek analyses, etc.


#### Thomas, advancement to candidacy
Worked with thomas on Vets day to send a plan to Ed outlining Thomas' plans for finishing his advancement to candidacy.
It looks like this:

Dear Ed,

Thank you for your message and encouragement to finalize my plan to candidacy.

I have fulfilled all of my required coursework and have formulated a plan as follows: 

I. __Committee Members:__ I have spoken to all of the following and they have all agreed to
serve as the members of my advancement committee.
  * Eric Anderson (thesis advisor)
  * Ed Green (chair of my advancement committee)
  * Beth Shapiro (outside of the department tenured faculty member) 
  * Josh Stuart ( BME faculty member)
 
  

II. __Timeline for advancement:__

a. __Written proposal:__
  * Complete draft to Eric: December 15
  * Second draft to Eric: December 31
  * Written proposal submitted to all other committee members: Mon, Jan 12
  
b. __Oral presentation:__
  * To be scheduled between Feb 9 - Feb 20 but not Feb 16, since it's observed holiday.
  
A title and brief synopsis of my proposed research follows.

##### Inferring pedigree structure from incompletely-sampled populations

I am developing an efficient MCMC algorithm that samples across pedigree
configurations based on their posterior distribution conditional on genotypic data and
other relevant phenotypic traits. Representing the pedigree as a factor graph provides a
rapid way to calculate marginals over all unobserved variables using a
_message passing algorithm_. This facilitates the
calculation of the joint probability of the genotype data given a proposed pedigree
structure and makes it possible to efficiently implement a Gibbs sampler over the
space of pedigrees. 

The above model yields an exact Gibbs sampler if all sampled pedigrees
are trees (possessing only a single path between every pair of nodes). For pedigrees that
are not trees, an
approximation is necessary. A popular way to handle the
loops is to pre-initalize the message passage variables and wait until the
values converge - which is known as the loopy belief propagation method. The first goal
of my thesis is to explore the utility and/or limitations of this loopy belief
propagation algorithm for pedigree data, and
also devise new ways to reconfigure the factor graph in order to eliminate any cycles.

I will then implement the inference algorithm in software and
demonstrate its efficacy in large population settings. I will apply this method to
SNP data (already gathered by the Molecular Ecology and Genetic Analysis Team at the 
Southwest Fisheries Science Center) from natural and managed salmon populations in
which incomplete sampling is a common event. 

I will also extend this method to polyploid species and apply it to
green sturgeon.  Further topics might include extending the method to multiallelic
markers.

All of the documents and work relevant to the upcoming advancement will be on this github repository: https://github.com/ngthomas/advancement. Since it is a private repository, can you send me your github username so that I can add you as a collaborator? Thanks.

I hope this plan matches to what you are looking for. Let me know if you have any questions or concern.

Thank you,
Thomas Ng

#### Other

1. Spent a little time trying to get the email monster under control.  Had a few hours of setting up various filters and things in gmail 
to get all the crap that comes in sent immediately to a JUNK folder.  
2. I spent an hour installing and reading about and trying out [Julia](http://julialang.org/) a language that we might
use to implement the PedFactory stuff.
3. Reading up on the `ggsubplot` package so I can figure out how to make some killer plots from CWT data to get our heads around
how that system works.
4. Did reading for Joint Journal club.
