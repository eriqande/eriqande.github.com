## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### big-creek

* (Fri) Established RODBC connectivity so I can connect to the SQL server with the PIT tag data.

### flock-comment / flockture

### Pata-chinook

* (Thu) Tracked down the bug that was giving me funky results.  Now I just have to set up a run on the big box and
summarize it.
* (Fri) Launched the simulations.  They will take maybe 5 to 6 hours and return all the results in big, compressed RDS file.
