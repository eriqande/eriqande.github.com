## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### SNPcontam
* Elena V is on winter break and came by to see me.  We talked about getting her work from the summer
in shape to submit as her honor's thesis.
* We also discussed doing the GSI stuff with the model for reporting units and correlated allele freq priors,
but I suspect that would be too much given her  spring track schedule, etc.


### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* I need to connect to the internal SQL data base.  Working on getting my ODBC solution working again.



### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* Got back to writing some code on flockture on Friday morning and Skyped with Patrick.
I ended up with a vexing malloc bug.  Left it till evening than squashed it.  New stuff
is all committed to the repo.
* Patrick had a look at that and found it behaving poorly.  I ran a series of tests and fixed a few little bugs.
Pushed that back up there and it seems to be performing more appropriately.



### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* The paper got rejected from _Evo Applications_ after review by the editor, Louis Bernatchez. He had
clearly read the whole thing and I thought his appraisal was appropriate --- basically it was, at
this point, a bit routine for _Evo Applications_.  I was quite impressed with the level of care
and detail of his comments.
* EP is adding in some stuff about estimated quantities of bycatch.


### Pata-chinook
[_https://github.com/eriqande/pata-chinook_](https://github.com/eriqande/pata-chinook)




### pbt-feasibility

* There was a lot of email chatter from the advisors of the PBT feasibility project about
how the group needs to tackle the issue of mass-marking and  what PBT would have to offer in that
case.  All of this tended to confirm my feeling that what I am working on (simulation on a 
coastswide scale) is absolutely esssential to this project.
* I spent some time fiddling around with aggregating locations so that I can get enough recoveries
to have a reasonable estimate of what is around in any fishery.  The CWT data base seems to have 
some weirdnesses, but I am getting familiar with it.
* Got that taken care of and have been moving on to estimating quantities.  Interestingly, even when you
aggregate things tremendously, in some collections of recoveries, 25% of the recoveries might be from release
groups that were observed only once.  Super sparse...
* Wednesday working on thinking through the details of the estimation problem I am doing with all the different
varieties of subsampling, etc.




### sib-prog-assess
[_https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess_](https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess)

Nothing here.  Gotta sit down with it over the break and start those colony simulations.


## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)





### Thomas Ng


## Service, Assistance, and Interaction
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC

* Helped Jamie from Lee Harrison's group with some R programming for adjusting river depths.
* Had a great conversation with Roy M about ERDDAP and mapping and R.  He sent me some info
on how to extract data from the ERDDAP using R.
* Continued with a fruitful email exchange about mapping issues.
* Helped Brian Spence with some R issues and sorting.


### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS



### Outside of NMFS



## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_
