## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)





### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* Got back to writing some code on flockture on Friday morning and Skyped with Patrick.
I ended up with a vexing malloc bug.  Left it till evening than squashed it.  New stuff
is all committed to the repo.




### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* The paper got rejected from _Evo Applications_ after review by the editor, Louis Bernatchez. He had
clearly read the whole thing and I thought his appraisal was appropriate --- basically it was, at
this point, a bit routine for _Evo Applications_.  I was quite impressed with the level of care
and detail of his comments.  




### pbt-feasibility

* There was a lot of email chatter from the advisors of the PBT feasibility project about
how the group needs to tackle the issue of mass-marking and  what PBT would have to offer in that
case.  All of this tended to confirm my feeling that what I am working on (simulation on a 
coastswide scale) is absolutely esssential to this project.
* I spent some time fiddling around with aggregating locations so that I can get enough recoveries
to have a reasonable estimate of what is around in any fishery.  The CWT data base seems to have 
some weirdnesses, but I am getting familiar with it.
