The R course is wrapping up and the lab Holiday party conflicts with one, so I have
a little more time to focus on other stuff.  The last two lectures are "Mapping with R"
and "dplyr". For both of these lectures I will be able to focus on problems I am 
working on for the PBT feasibility, so I am pleased about that.

In fact, I ended up having a conflict for next tuesday, so the R course is finished
as of Tuesday, Dec 9, 2014.  


## Projects


_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)





### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)

* Wrote up a blurb about how to efficiently do both the leave one out and the zero-allele frequency
corrections in _flockture_.  This should make it easier to implement, cleanly.
* Skyped with Patrick on Friday.   I gotta get _flockture_ done!
* Worked on Wed afternoon on getting the leave-one-out in flockture implemented.  I should point out that
the reason I am doing this is so that we have a fast platform for understanding how flock behaves.




### herring

### pbt-feasibility

* Making some progress here, and looking forward to more now that I am done with the
course.  I have been spending time recently figuring out at what scale I should aggregate
recoveries over different locations.





### sib-prog-assess
[_https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess_](https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess)


### patagonian-chinook 

* I've just started work joining Javi, Carla and Carlos (among others?) to finish up a paper on
Chinook in Patagonia.  They have used _gsisim_ to identify the likely origin of fish in the
Santa Cruz River.  This is something of an "off-label" use for GSI, and I just wanted to add to the
paper a quick set of simulations to see how GSI works in this context.
* I continued to work on this quite a bit Friday night and Saturday.  But it stalled while I
wrote my last R course lecture.

## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)

* I spent most of Monday and Tuesday dealing with plotting of spatial data in R.  I was pleased with how the 
lecture came together.  Check it out [here](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html#map-making-in-R)
* All done!



### Thomas Ng


## Service and Assistance
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC




### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS



### Outside of NMFS



## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_

* On Wednesday, I spent some time sitting in on the WC-GSI consortium meeting that was being held here at the lab.
* On Wed, I also completed the required No-FEAR act briefing.
