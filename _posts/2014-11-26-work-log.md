## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)

* On Friday I cranked out some cool stuff with devon that led to this cool plot:
![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/family_length_is_yoy.png "Optional title")
It shows that by taking the inferred sibling groups and plotting the lengths of the
fish, it is pretty easy to identify which sibling groups are young of the year and
which are not.
* I continued with this a bit on Sunday night, wrapping up the results for Devon so he can
give them to Lindley to put run it in the recapture models.




### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)






### herring
[_https://github.com/eriqande/herring_](https://github.com/eriqande/herring)

* Reading and editing the manuscript on Monday.




### pbt-feasibility

* Continued chugging through the RMIS data bases, familiarizing myself with them and
cleaning them up (dealing with partial dates, etc.).
* Sunday night I focused particularly on the releases data base.  I think it is going to be good to 
focus on the period from a recent decade, but they don't have all the info in it for 2013 or 2014, and it would be good to have releases for all recoveries within a decade.  So, maybe I can focus on all the recoveries from 2002 to 2012 and do all the releases from 1995 to 2010 or something.
* I am going to provide a separate Rmd summary document for each of the 4 different RMIS data bases
so that I can document what I am using and how I am doing it.




### sib-prog-assess
[_https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess_](https://github.com/eriqande/sib-prog-assess)



## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)

1. On Thursday, I quickly through together a lecture/presentation on wide vs. long format
data, the `reshape2` package, and further explorations in `ggplot`.
