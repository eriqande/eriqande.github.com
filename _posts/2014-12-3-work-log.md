## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)

* Friday night I spent a long bit of time getting my new laptop all set up to serve the course
up and crunch it out with Jekyll, etc.
* I then also fiddled around a bit with how to plot GPX tracks using `ggmap` and `ggplot2`.  It is
pretty darn straightforward.  There is a package `plotKML` that has a `readGPX` function that is 
useful.  `plotKML` does have a lot of dependencies though which took some wrangling to get them
all working.  But you can easily make things that look pretty nice.
