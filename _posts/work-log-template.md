This week I have been relishing the chance to not have any lecture-writing
deadlines until Tuesday (which is at the end of my week which runs from 
Wednesday night to the following Wednesday afternoon for reporting purposes.


## Projects

_By projects here I mean things that are leading to manuscripts on which I am an author.
I try to maintain headings here for ones that should be on the front burner even if I didn't
work on them this week._

### big-creek
[_https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek (private repo)_](https://github.com/eriqande/big-creek)





### flock-comment / flockture
[_https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment_](https://github.com/eriqande/flock-comment)
and [_https://github.com/eriqande/flockture_](https://github.com/eriqande/flockture)






### herring

## Teaching and Advising


### rep-res-course
[_Course Web Site_](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/)  
[_Course GitHub Repository_](https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course)

1. Reading widely on ggplot and formulating how I want to present the grammar of graphics
and how I want to teach use of ggplot.
2. Developing a nice simple example for ggplot from pole vaulting records.




### Thomas Ng


## Service and Assistance
_Help to other researchers both in the lab and outside of the lab_


### Within SWFSC

1. Helping Sam Rizza with some newhybrids questions for his cutt/sh project.



### Outside of SWFSC but within NMFS

1. Got the `snppit` repository in better shape because Mike Ford wanted to download it
and use it.


### Outside of NMFS

1. Assistance to NewHybs user
2. Read a manuscript on Patagonian Chinook for javi and gave him comments.  `/Users/eriq/Documents/work/assist/javier_cancio/patagonian_chinook/CaterinaSNP_text_30_10_14_eca.doc`
I think the paper would benefit from a sensitivity analysis and slightly different
presentation of the results.



## Non-project
_Other things that are not projects, teaching, nor service/assistance.  Mostly time I
spend on infrastructure and learning new things_

1. Pulling together a work-log template (the one you are reading!)
